## JavaScript & DOM Fundamentals

**DOM (Document Object Model)** - a model in which the document or web page contains objects (elements, links, etc.) that can be manipulated

* **Builtin methods & Standard Data Types**
  * Objects
  * Arrays
  * Strings
  * Numbers

* **ES6**
  * Arrow functions
  * rest/spread operator
  * default parameters
  * destructuring

* **Closures**
  * How does the function scope behave?

* **Callbacks** - function used by another function to signal when there is a result ready

* **Promises** - a way to deal with with future values
  * When a function returns a promise, you can attach a callback using `.then()` to run after the promise resolves passing in the value of the resolved promise to the callback function
  * i.e. `someFunction().then(val => console.log(val))`

* **Functions & Pure Functions**
  * NB: learn about pure functions to get a handle on functional programming.

* **Functional Programming Basics**
  * Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions, avoiding shared state & mutable data.

* **Partial Application & Curry**

* **AJAX & Server API Calls**
  * NB: know how to communicate with APIs

* **Classes**

* **Generators**

* **async/await**

* **Node & Express**
