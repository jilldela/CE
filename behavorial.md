# Behavorial Questions

### What are 3 of your weaknesses?
* **Perfectionist**
* **Putting others first**
* **I like to be a part of everything**
* **Lack attention to detail** Sometimes I can miss the edge cases or lack seeing small details in trying to solve the big picture. I know that this can lead to major bugs that can be difficult to find so I try to probe questions about scope and constraints to help me find these details and be mindful of them before I even start to attempt solving a problem
