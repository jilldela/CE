// For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. 
// So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, 
// whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

// 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

// 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

// 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
// You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

var constructRectangle = function(area) {
    w = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(area));
    
    while (area % w !== 0) w--;
    
    return [area / w, w];
};
