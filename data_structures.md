# Data Structures

## Linear Data Structures

### Array
* stores homogeneous elements at contiguous locations
* **Accessing time: O(1)** by indexing into array
* **Search time:** 
  * **O(n)** sequentially
  * **O(log n)** by Binary Search if array is sorted
* **Insertion time: O(n)** if element inserted in beginning of array and all elements need to be shifted
* **Deletion time: O(n)** same explanation as insertion

* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue

## Binary Tree
* a sequence of nodes in which there are a root node, left node, and right node.

## Linked List
* A Linked List is a **sequence of nodes** in which each node holds the value/data for the node and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. 
* Connections can be uni-directional (**singly linked list**) with reference to only the next node; or bi-directional (**doubly linked list**) with references to both previous and next nodes.
