### What is a Linked List?
* A Linked List is a **sequence of nodes** in which each node holds the value/data for the node and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. 
* Connections can be uni-directional (**singly linked list**) with reference to only the next node; or bi-directional (**doubly linked list**) with references to both previous and next nodes.
