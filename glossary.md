# Glossary

#### Class Inheritance
* instances inherit from classes and create sub-class relationships

#### Function Composition
* the process of combining two or more functions in order to produce a new function or perform a computation.

#### Functional Programming (FP)
* process of building software by composing **pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects**

#### Immutability
* cannot be modified after creation

#### Mutability
* can be modified after creation

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* program in which the **data type of a data structure and its functions are defined**
* organized around object rather than functions and data rather than logic

#### Procedural Programming

#### Programming Paradigms 
* ways of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles

#### Pure Function
* a function which **given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side-effects**

#### Side Effects
* any application state change that is observable outside the function being called other than its return value
* i.e. modification of external variable or object property; triggering external process; console log; writing to screen, file, or network

#### Shared State
* any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes
