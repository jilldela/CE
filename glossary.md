# Glossary

#### Binding
* capture environment (variables, methods, this/self, etc.) that are in-scope at the current point of a program and make them available in another context
* encapsulate all of the in-scope variables and methods, storing them in an object, so that the current context can be passed around and used in another context

#### Class Inheritance
* instances inherit from classes and create sub-class relationships

#### Cookies
* client information stored on the server that persists even if the user navigates to a different site, or closes the tab or browser.
* consists of a name, value, and other optional attributes
* Cookies are added to the client's browser by putting them into the response

#### Function Composition
* the process of combining two or more functions in order to produce a new function or perform a computation.

#### Functional Programming (FP)
* process of building software by composing **pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects**

#### Immutability
* cannot be modified after creation

#### Linked List
* **sequence of nodes** in which each node holds the value/data for the node and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. Connections can be uni-directional (singly linked list) with reference to only the next node or bi-directional (doubly linked list) with reference to both previous and next nodes.

#### Mutability
* can be modified after creation

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* program in which the **data type of a data structure and its functions are defined**
* organized around object rather than functions and data rather than logic

#### Pass By Reference
* When a function takes a reference to the original object and will act on the object

#### Pass By Value
* When a function takes an argument, it makes a copy of the argument and does not mutate the original

#### Procedural Programming

#### Programming Paradigms 
* ways of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles

#### Pure Function
* a function which **given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side-effects**

#### Router
* matches requested paths to the appropriate controller, instantiate the route's controller, and run the appropriate action/method within the controller

#### Side Effects
* any application state change that is observable outside the function being called other than its return value
* i.e. modification of external variable or object property; triggering external process; console log; writing to screen, file, or network

#### Shared State
* any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes
